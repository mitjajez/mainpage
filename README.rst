Then just run the docker-compose up, which will set up the database create media and static folders, merge the database, and bring up the production server for mainpage.

```sh
docker-compose up

### About

This repository was a big part of my 2017 Gsoc project, it was suppose to revive the unmaintained repository of wlan-si.net web-page, which had a lot of broken dependencies, outdated dependencies and was not yet running inside of a docker container.

I managed to successfully create docker containers for both website and database but my lack of django knowledge left me short of actually fixing the django project that was suppose to run.

### Future

All that is left is for someone to fix the broken django project-
